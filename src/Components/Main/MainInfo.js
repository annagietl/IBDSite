        Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the digestive tract. 
        The two main types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease can affect any part 
        of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus, while ulcerative colitis only affects the colon and 
        rectum. IBD is characterized by inflammation in the digestive tract, which can lead to symptoms such as 
        abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. The cause of IBD is not fully understood, but it is 
        thought to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While there is no cure for IBD, 
        there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms and reduce inflammation in the digestive tract. 
        Treatment options may include medication, lifestyle changes, and in some cases, surgery.
